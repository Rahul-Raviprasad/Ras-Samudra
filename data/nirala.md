## Suryakant tripati nirala.

1936 lucknow in congress house, nirala spoke to Gandhi on his remark that hindi doesn't have anyone like Rabindranath tagore.
Indore ke sammalan mein kaha ki hindi mrty ho rahi hai.

how many poets had gandhi read?
what's the impact on the writers of hindi from such comments?

Gandhi agreed he doesn't know much about hindi.

have you read jaya shankar prasad, pant?

21 February 1899 was born on basant panchami (saraswati pujan ka din hai.)
maa ne naam surya kumar rakha, weh surya pujan karti thi.
baad mein Nirala ne khud naam badal kar suryakant kar liya.


maha pran Nirala

apney kitab parivan mein likha bhi hai, manushyon ki mukhti kaam ke bandan se mukti paana hai, aur kaviyon ki mukti chandon ke shasan se mukti paana hai

nirala ne jitni bhi paise they 1000 rupee kisi ko dediye jab unhone beta shabd suna.

Three of his greatest works are
* Saroj Smirithi
* Ram ki Sakhti puja
* Saraswati wandana- war de veena vaadini.


unka vivah 15 ki ayu mein manohara devi se ho gaya tha

kayiyon ka maana hai shayad tulsi das ke bhajano ke uke mukh se sun kar hi unki rachna viksit hui hon.
